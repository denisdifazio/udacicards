## Introduction

This is the third and last project of
[Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
course which students were asked to build a flashcard mobile application
(Android or iOS - or both) using React Native.

This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native
application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in
your machine. Furthermore, you will also need [Expo](https://expo.io/) installed
in your device. After that, just clone the repository and run the following
commands in your command shell at the repository directory:

* `npm install` or `yarn install`
* `npm start` or `yarn start`

Wait for an QRCode to show on the terminal then use it in you Expo App option
`Scan QR Code`.

This app was tested on a Lenovo A7010a48 (Android 6.0) and a Apple iPhone 5S
(iOS).
